<p>During your literature review, you should:</p>

<ol>
<li>Identify primary source articles that address the association that you have decided to examine</li>
<li>Download relevant articles.</li>
<li>Read the articles that seem to test the association most directly.</li>
<li>Identify replicated and equivocal findings in order to generate a more focused question that may add to the literature. Give special attention to the future research sections of the articles that you read</li>
<li>Based on the literature, select additional questions/items/ variables that may help you to understand the association of interest. In doing so, further refine your research question. Add relevant documentation (i.e. code book pages) to your personal codebook.</li>
</ol>

<p>##Example:</p>

<p>Given the association that I have decided to examine, I use such keywords as <em>nicotine dependence</em>, <em>tobacco dependence</em>, and <em>smoking</em>. After reading through several titles and abstracts, I notice that there has been relatively little attention in the research literature to the association between smoking exposure and nicotine dependence. I expand a bit to include other substance use that provides relevant background as well.</p>

<p>Based on my reading of the articles in the <strong>References</strong> as well as others, I have noted a few common and interesting themes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>While it is true that smoking exposure is an ecessary requirement for nicotine dependence, frequency and quantity of smoking are markedly imperfect indices for determining an individuals probability of exhibiting nicotine dependence (this is true for other drugs as well)</p></li>
<li><p>The association may differ based on ethnicity, age, and gender (although there is little work on this)</p></li>
<li><p>One of the most potent risk factors consistently implicated in the etiology of smoking behavior and nicotine dependence is depression</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have decided to further focus my question by examining whether the association between nicotine dependence and depression differs based on how much a person smokes. I am wondering if at low levels of smoking compared to high levels, nicotine dependence is more common among individuals with major depression than those without major depression.  I add relevant depression questions/items/variables to my personal codebook as well as several demographic measures (age, gender, ethnicity, etc.) and any other variables I may wish to consider.</p>
